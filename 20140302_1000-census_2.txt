  Microdata: the secret sauce of Census
    http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4024/
  Enter the matrix
    Census asks questions and breaks down the answers in one or more ways.
    If you want answers broken down any other way, though, you can use microdata.
      Reduced sample size
      Potentially large margins of error
      Can be difficult to work with
      Tough to explain to editors and ultimately your audience
    Hard part
      Download the data
        U.S. Census Bureau (recent years only)
        IPUMS (since 1800s, harmonized)
      Analyze the data

        Severely cost-burdened (costs more than 50 percent of monthly income)

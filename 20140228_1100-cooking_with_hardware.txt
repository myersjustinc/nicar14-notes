John Keefe, WNYC
  Made his hoodie read the signal from his exercise heart rate monitor and blink with his heartbeat
  Made a sort of VU meter/one-bar chart that shows Chartbeat traffic
  Made a sleep monitor that he strapped to his arm

Liza Stark, Parsons
  Don't need wires to make a circuit
    Can make conductive Play-Doh that works well ("Squishy Circuits")
  Arduino
    Small, $35 microcontroller/computer that lets you connect the physical and digital worlds
    Developed for interaction designers, not engineers
    Free development environment: http://arduino.cc/
  Created some bend/pressure sensors for a welcome mat that says "Welcome" on the session's projector when people walk on it
  Made a skin-conductance (stress-detecting) apron

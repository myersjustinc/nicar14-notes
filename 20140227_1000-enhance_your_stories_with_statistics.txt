  P-values
    Statistical significance level
    Is the probability of the null hypothesis below a certain value?
      Often 0.05 or 0.01
    Doesn't mean the observed result isn't impossible
      Just means it's highly unlikely
  t-tests
    Used to test hypotheses about means when the population variance is unknown (which is usually the case)
    Originally developed for quality control of beer
    Three varieties:
      Single sample
        One group to test against hypothetical mean
      Independent samples
        Two means, two groups, no relationship between them
        People are randomly assigned to a single group
      Dependent samples
        Two means
        Some relationship in how people are assigned to groups
  ANOVA
    Collection of methods
    Analyze differences between group means
    Generalize t-test to more than two groups
    Can be done within groups or between groups
  Fisher's exact test
    Fun for very small data sets
    Gives you an exact p-value
    Great for categorical data
  Linear regression
    Trying to find the best-fit predictive line for a set of data
    Remember the slope-intercept equation for a line: y = m * x + b
      m = slope, which is useful here
    r^2
      How much does the independent variable predict the dependent variable?
      More than 0.8 is crazy good
    Only good for continuous data, not categorical
  Logistic regression
    Do this instead for categorical (or at least not always continuous) data
      Gender
      Race
      Really handy for two groups (binary logistic regression)
  Pearson's chi-squared
    Observed value versus expected value
    What does a "regular" situation look like?
    Does something odd appear more frequently than it ought to?
  How to avoid mistakes
    Try to prove yourself wrong
    Run your conclusions by your targets
    Ask someone smarter than you
      Ask someone who does this for a living
        "Academics love to poke holes in things." -Rob
    Make sure you're doing the correct test
      You can run just about any test on just about any data set
        Doesn't make it useful

  Don't overthink: Most of what you do will be:
    Counting
    Summing
    Grouping
    Ranking
  Seeking the middle
    The most descriptive element of a group of things is often found in the center
    Mean
      Average of a set of numbers
      Add set together, divide by number of elements
    Median
      Middle element of set
      If even number of elements, take the mean of the middle two
    Often can write very different sentences depending on whether you use mean or median
      Mean is sensitive to outliers, median isn't
  Other descriptive tools
    Quartiles
      Median plus medians of each half
    Correlation
      Degree to which groups of numbers vary together
      Ranges from -1 (numbers move in opposite directions) to +1 (numbers move in same direction)
  Histograms
    Count of things in equal-sized ranges in your data
    Bar chart of distribution of values
  Be able to quickly visualize things, even if the initial visualizations look sort of terrible
    Useful for getting a sense of the story
  Distribution types
    Normal
      Typical bell curve
    Log-normal distribution
      Long tail to one side
      Distribution of logs of the values is normal
    Cauchy distribution
      Sort of looks like a really tall bell curve
        (Not clear yet to me what the difference is)
    Knowing the distribution of a set of numbers gives you more statistical options.
  Monte Carlo simulation
    Randomly select values from the distribution the data ought to have
    Does what you picked match up with the data in real life?

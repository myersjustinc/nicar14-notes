  Twitter is much more useful than Facebook for searching breaking news events
    Use the desktop site since it doesn't auto-refresh
      Just lets you know how many updates there are and lets you show them whenever
    Be broad when you search
      "shooting" won't catch "shot"
      "Get anything people are possibly saying"
      "RIP" won't match "R.I.P."
      Search names, usernames of victims
  Screenshot everything--no guarantee what you see now will be there later
    Many things get taken down
  Arrest records
  Wage garnishments
  File records requests as soon as the event happens
    Yelling at people asking for it isn't good enough
  LexisNexis lists lots of email addresses and cell phone numbers now

  Gather sources ahead of time
    Who will be useful?
    How will/do various officials respond to situations?
    Organize this so people in your newsroom can use it easily.
  Get useful lists for specific events
    Infrastructure
      Utilities
      Shelter
      Transportation
    Demographics
  Consider a dashboard/automated alert system
    If you can't find one, build one
  Find a way to present timelines/chronological information
    Gives you a logical way to organize the information you have
    Useful internally, but also handy for audience
    Tabletop comes in handy for this so multiple people can edit it
  Recurring public interactives give you some structure
    Abstract out development for things you'll do over and over again
    Focus on what's new about this event and on the human angle
  "Be prepared, run through scenarios because they're fun, and horde information."

  OSHA safety inspections also are handy to have around in case something happens at a construction site

Tools for cracking PDFs

Jeremy Merrill, The New York Times
  Ask for just about anything other than a PDF first.
    Seriously, just about anything else will be easier to deal with.
  PDFs support attaching other files (i.e., raw data) as well, but nobody does this.
    Tutorial you can send to agencies: http://youtu.be/CKDWr1h8Y9c
  PDFs can have actual text in them or not
    If actual text is in there, great!
      Tabula (http://tabula.nerdpower.org/) and pdftotext (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) only work in this case.
    Otherwise, you'll have to use optical character recognition (OCR) of some sort.
      This involves a program reading the images in the file and seeing what letters/numbers/etc. they look like.
      Gets messy: Zeros often get mistaken for Os, etc.
      Some more expensive tools work pretty well sometimes (e.g., Abbyy).
      DocumentCloud also does this automatically with varying amounts of success.

  DocHive is meant for image-based PDFs.
    It uses templates that specify the structure of the page, and the process is automated from that point.
    Still in development
      No GUI version available yet, but hopefully a Web-based one this weekend
      Come to the Friday hands-on

  Also keep Cometdocs in mind: http://www.cometdocs.com/
    Free accounts, but more capabilities available with premium accounts
      $10/month, or free with IRE membership! Email jgreen@ire.org for details.
  Zamzar: http://zamzar.com/
    Try this and Cometdocs at the same time and see what works better.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not upload really sensitive documents (national security, personal privacy, etc.) to a Web-based service.

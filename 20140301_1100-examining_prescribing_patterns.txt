Prescription data
  Pharmaceutical companies buy it through middlemen who buy it from pharmacies
  Middlemen would not sell it to ProPublica for any price
  Went with Medicare data instead
    One out of every four prescriptions in U.S.
    Consistently handled across country
    FOIA-able

FOIA process
  Found list of what's gathered on ResDAC (resdac.org)
    Did not retrieve data from ResDAC since they require you not to match with individual doctors
  Worked with Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials early and often to craft request
    Met with more than a dozen CMS officials
  Know what you're actually interested in
    Lets you negotiate what you'll allow to be redacted
    "I need this, but I can live without this."

Medicare prescribing data
  Prescribing data by provider ID from 2007 to 2010 (later included 2011)
  For each prescriber and drug:
    Total number of claims
    Retail cost of drug (by brand and National Drug Code)
    Days of supply
    Number of units (pills or ounces)
  Prescribing data for patients 65 and older
  CMS did some additional analysis for ProPublica that they couldn't do themselves due to redactions
  Received data in SAS files
    Read in SPSS, loaded onto SQL server
    Reporters could use whatever SQL clients they wanted
  CMS included unique IDs for prescribers
    Provided separate lookup table linking that to NPI and DEA IDs

Beyond Part D dta
  CMS NPI registration data is available on website to ID doctors
  DEA has list of registered prescribers, but they don't sell it
    National Technical Information Service does, however
  Data from First Databank helped categorize drugs
  Data from American Geriatric Society on drugs dangerous to seniors (Beers)
  Scraped drug information sites for top drugs

Medicare prescribing data
  Talked to many experts about how to best examine the data and develop methodologies
  Within categories, did crosstabs to look for doctors who did not follow mattern
    Prescribed at rates more than 2 standard deviations from mean for category
  Talked to those who prescribed high amounts or in unusual ways

What ProPublica found
  Medicare's failure to keep watch over Part D enabled:
    Inappropriate and risky prescribing
    Billions of dollars in waste
    Fraud
  Also found clear signs that doctors who had relationships with pharmaceutical companies prescribed more name-brand drugs

Problems
  Some prescriptions from other physicians within a clinic or practice were attributed to one physician.
  In some cases, pharmacies entered the wrong provider ID.
  In some cases, prescriptions were attributed to dummy prescribers.

Other prescribing data
  State Medicaid prescription data
  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs

New in 2014
  CMS will release new data on:
    Prescribing in Part D for 2012
    Physician payments in Medicare Part B
    Pharmaceutical and medical device company payments to doctors
      "So far we have data on 15 drug companies and what they pay. You will have data on _every_ drug company and what they pay." -Charles

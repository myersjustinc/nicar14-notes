  "Not everything that can be counted counts. Not everything that counts can be counted" -William Bruce Cameron
    A data set is only as good as the reporting on which it's based.
    Be careful with comparisons.
  Checkups for doctors
    Medicare Exclusions Database
      http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/
      Search for individuals and entities excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs
      Can be based on billing fraud and/or inadequate quality of care
      Also includes reinstatements--be sure to look for this
      Officially known as LEIE
    State medical boards
      Transparency and approach vary widely from state to state
        Federation of State Medical board has searchable data of all states' reported actions: http://www.fsmb.org/m_fpdc.html
        Administrative hearing records and legal filings contain a ton of great information.
          Ask whether there are administrative complaints.
    National Practitioner Data Bank
      NPDB Public Use File: http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/publicData.jsp
      Does not include names or identifying info for individual physicians
      Does include state licensure actions, malpractice payments, clinical privilege actions, etc.
      Still useful
        Can determine if state boards are reporting actions to NPDB as required
        Can determine if state boards are taking actions when doctors lose clinical privileges
        Can compile especially bad records on malpractice claims

    Does that personally affect them?

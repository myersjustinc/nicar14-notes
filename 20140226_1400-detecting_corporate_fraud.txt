What is corporate fraud?
  A few kinds:
    Securities fraud: ripping off investors
    Consumer fraud: ripping off (retail) customers
    Tax fraud: ripping off taxpayers
  Bottom line: Fraud boils down to saying one thing and doing another, for profit.

What drives corporate fraud?
  Greed
  Pressure: make quarterly numbers or else
  Incompetence: making up for mistakes

Finding fraud
  Compare what they say to what they do
  Corporate fraud reporting is accountability reporting

Caveat reporter
  No one red flag always indicates fraud
  Not every example that raises eyebrows amounts to fraud
  Talk to the company

Some things actually are wrong on their face
  Like the guy who had 999,999,999,999 shares of ExxonMobil

Basics: the filings
  Key points:
    Mostly publicly traded companies
    Limited regulatory review
    Disclosure, not substance
    Dense, complex and long
      "It's just words and numbers; you can figure it out." -Theo
  Where to find them:
    SEC's EDGAR database: http://1.usa.gov/1f3TpOM
  How to use them:
    Reynolds Center's SEC filing primers: http://bit.ly/1f3Tt0P

Get a grip: the 10s
  Primary financial and operational disclosures for established public companies
  10-K: annual, audited, comprehensive
  10-Q: quarterly (3x/yr), unaudited, more incremental

Get a grip: other filings
  S-1: primary filing for companies about to go public (pre-IPO)
    Updated by multiple amendments
  8-K: recent developments, press releases, etc.
    Widely variable
    May include additional information that isn't just in the press release

Get a grip: key elements
  10-K, 10-Q, S-1
    Business
    Risk factors
    Litigation and regulatory developments
  S-1
    Capital structure
    Origins of the company
    Key investors
  Proxy and S-1
    Compensation (what gets rewarded?)
    Beneficial ownership (major investors)

Foreign companies (companies domiciled abroad with operations in the U.S.):
  File a Form 20-F and Forms 6-F

Wells notice: SEC says they intend to sue the company
  Pay attention if these happen

A lot depends on what the company counts as "material"

Get a grip: what to look for
  Late filings
    Especially 10-K and 10-Q (NT 10-K and NT 10-Q)
    Consider the company's explanation
    Sometimes include statements that previous filings should not be relied on
      This is not good.
  Does the business make sense?
  Has the business changed fundamentally, especially multiple times?

Get a grip: What's core?
  General Electric
    Power turbines, jet engines, medical imaging, dishwashers, etc.
    Half of GE's 2004 revenues and earnings came from GE Capital
      https://app.seclive.com/#f/57cd417f
      "Most of middle America, when they declare bankruptcy, owe money to GE Capital." -Roddy
      "They're a credit card company with a medical imaging arm." -Roddy
      Today it's more like 31 percent.

  Company website: PR but still useful
  Press releases: BusinessWire, PR Newswire, Yahoo Finance, etc.
  Company transcripts (Seeking Alpha's are free)
  Former employees
  Customers
  Vendors
  Investors (past and present)

Who's who: Know your principals
  People matter
  10-K, S-1, proxy: executive and director bios
  Proxy: insider stakes (beneficial ownership)
  Forms 3, 4, 5: insider transactions; executives, directors and big investors
    Complicated; get help if you're considering analyzing these
  Schedules 13G and 13D: big investors, voting agreements
    Who has gone above or below owning 5 percent of the company?
    Theoretically, 13G is passive and 13D is active (in terms of attempts at control)
      In practice, not always much difference
    Watch out for attachments

Who's who: what to look for
  Initially, grab all of it
    Names: people, companies, charities
      FINRA BrokerCheck
        Lots of people need to hold various FINRA licenses and such
        Look for "disclosure events": mistakes, sanctions, ethics issues, etc.
        FINRA loves helping reporters
    Previous ventures
    Addresses
      Residencies, vehicle registrations, etc. in tax-friendly jurisdictions
      Second homes, especially to help with arrest records
      Florida lets you keep your home no matter what happens to you
        State laws generally govern what assets may be seized
      Sunny places with lots of rich people are red flags for investors
        Especially Boca Raton, San Antonio, Palm Beach
  Things that make you go "hm"
    Resume gaps
    Undisclosed jobs
    Same names crop up in different roles
      Keeping it in the family
    Stock dips and jumps
      Does the company like to buy lots of its own stock?
    Repeated overpromising, underdelivery
    Missing disclosures
    Moving assets into spouses' and children's names, family trusts, etc.
  More innocuous (usually)
    Terrible jobs
    One or two layoffs
  Check these out
    Education, particularly:
      Specialized degrees/expertise
      Attendance vs. degree
      Diploma mills and dubious online schools
        Oregon Department of Education keeps a list of unaccredited institutions
    Litigation
      Corporate
      Personal
      Professional
  Don't forget help
    Lawyers
    PR firms
      Especially Corbis (sp?)
    Consultants
    Exceptions: crisis PR firms, defense lawyers, etc.
  Scenario: ditching the troubled founder
    Are they really?
    Relatives and associates
    LLCs
      Nevada, Michigan, Alaska, Virginia, Wyoming:
        Creditor cannot seize a person's membership interest in the LLC
        Person transfers management of LLC to someone else
        Creditor tries to seize some assets, waits for LLC to distribute earnings to person
        LLC doesn't distribute earnings, but issues an IRS K-1 because it's phantom income
        Because creditor claims an interest in those phantom assets, LLC issues K-1 to creditor instead, so creditor owes taxes on assets they won't receive
  Blame game
    CEO pins operational problems on everyone else
  Domineering CEOs
    Surrounded by yes-men
    Demands results without fail
    No tolerance for dissent or missed targets
  Culture of corruption
    Tone at the top
    Tangled financial and personal relationships
      "Related party transactions"

Who's who: buried treasure
  Chesapeake Energy's disclosure at the top here:

  More generally, Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake Energy

Who's who: next steps
  Who to background:
    Executives
    Directors
    Major investors
    Lawyers
    PR people
    Consultants (especially in technical industries)
    LLCs and similar entities
  What to check:
    Educational institutions and degrees

      Discharge (honorable, etc.)
      Tours of duty
      "Special forces"
        Stolen Valor
    Past jobs
      Independent confirmation
      Past coworkers

Ties that bind: the filings
  Proxy: "related party transaction" section
  10-K (sometimes an amendment or section here in lieu of proxy filing)
  Other names
    Related party transactions
    Related person transactions
    Certain transactions
  What insiders are doing business with what other insiders?

Ties that bind: what to look for
  Main question: Why is the insider the best choice?
  Commodity transactions
  Confusion, dead ends, obfuscation
  Layers of LLCs or other private companies
    Especially if they tie back to the same people
    Especially if those people are executives, directors or big investors
  Company employees doing work on executives' homes
  Exceptions:
    Private equity investors
      These get really complicated really quickly
    Founders and founding families

Ties that bind: next steps
  Location
    What else is at that address?
  State corporation filings
    Secretary of state, state incorporation office, etc.
  Legal databases
  Court documents

Nanoviricides example (http://1.usa.gov/1fTUWSJ)
  CFO married to CEO (can't be compelled to testify)
  CEO and chairman have large stake in major investor (TheraCour)
  TheraCour owns all of Nanoviricide's intellectual property
  Opaque and confusing preferred stock details between executives and the two companies

DHB Industries example (http://1.usa.gov/1fTUbJ7)
  Rents space from CEO's wife's company
  Buys key components from CEO's wife's company
  Leases space to CEO's wife's company
  Sold key components to wife's company at cost
  Chartered plane from CEO's company

Measuring up
  10-Q financial basics: http://bit.ly/1jskFFp
  "Funny Money: How companies play games with numbers": http://slidesha.re/1jsjG8c

Measuring up: receivables
  Accounts receivable: money owed to the company, generally by customers
  Big swings in dollar terms or as a percent of revenue
  Collectability
  Concentration of risk (risk factors section)
  Footnotes
    Rising accounts receivable should mean rising delinquencies (amounts past due for 90 days)
    Company may be hiding uncollectable sales

Measuring up: payables
  Accounts payable: money the company owes, generally to suppliers
    Profitable company with rapidly increasing accounts payable implies the company may not be paying its bills

  Bottom line:
    It's all relative
      3 percent increase in revenues, but what's happening with net income, receivables, etc.?
    It's about change over time
      Big spikes
      Sudden drops
    Check the details
      Has the change been disclosed?
      Is it a related party transaction?

Measuring up: gaming sales
  Sales are supposed to be recorded in the quarter that the goods/services are delivered if payment is likely to be received
  Possible games:
    Recognizing sales too soon
      "Accelerating" sales made early one quarter so they count for the prior quarter
      Recognizing multi-year contracts all at once
    Recognizing sales too late
      Recording them early the following quarter, if this quarter is already going well

Watch out when a company buys one of its major distributors

Measuring up: cookie jars
  Reserves account for expected future costs
    Some percentage of customers won't pay their bills
    Inventories become obsolete, spoil or otherwise lose value
  Reserve math
    Establishing a reserve reduces income (profits)
    Reversing part or all of a reserve increases income (profits) on paper
  Cookie-jar accounting
    "Releasing" reserves to generate income
    Artificially inflating reserves for later release

Measuring up: more fun
  Manipulating expenses
  Manipulating inventories
  Rearranging deck chairs
    Changing how you categorize sales from quarter to quarter to make them harder to compare
  Endless adjustments/updates
  Ballooning debt with little financial growth to show for it

Arthrocare example (https://app.seclive.com/#f/cc0af284)
  ArthroCare Spine segment revenues for Sept. 30 quarter:
    9 percent of total in 2006
    15 percent of total in 2007
  Extremely competitive market for spinal devices
  Competitors are bigger and well-funded
    Johnson & Johnson
    Striker
  Kickback allegations
  Bought distributor
    Secret board vote at 11:15 p.m. on Dec. 31
    "Parked" millions of dollars in merchandize with distributors
      $37 million in sales to one distributor, but only $50,000 in _net_ sales
  Several executives tried or facing trial, including CEO

Red flag factories: "soft tells"
  When red flags start multiplying, watch out

Red flag factories: the filings
  8-K, 10-K, 10-Q
    Auditor changes
    Director departures
      Letters to the board--often fun reading
    Litigation and regulatory action
  10-K
    Auditor's note
  Proxy
    Auditor fees
      Especially fees that aren't for audits
  Other
    SEC staff comment letters
      Delayed by several weeks/months, but still useful
      Also gives you cover--SEC is asking questions, so you're just checking

Red flags: auditor oddities
  Big company, small auditor
  Audit vs. consulting fees
  Sudden departures
  Saying there were no substantial disagreements is fiction
    "Substantial disagreements" is very narrowly defined

Red flags: next steps
  PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board): http://pcaobus.org/
    Audits auditors
    Insight into accounting firm's quality
    Audit clients usually not named
  Always call departing directors, especially if there's a letter
  Short interest
    If many investors are selling the shares short, why?
